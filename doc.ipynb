    "#### **OVERALL SUMMARY:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* All attributes have 777 entries, indicating **no missing values** for any of the numerical features.\n",
    "* Also, Attribute `Grad.Rate` has maximum value of 118 typically says that there is obvious **data errors** since graduation rate cannot exceed 100%\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identifying Presence Of Potential Outliers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "From observation of statistical data, we Suspect the presence of outliers in the following attributes = **['Apps', 'Accept', 'Enroll', 'F.Undergrad', 'P.Undergrad', 'Outstate', 'Expend']**. So, Steps have taken and confirmed the **presence of Outliers** by observing the following results.\n",
    "* Coefficient of Variation **(COV)** of every attribute in the above list is higher, **Mean > Median > Mode** for every attribute of the list and further Skewness Coefficient for every attribute further shows their values are higher than 0.5. So, these attributes have potential outliers and **right-Skewed**. Meaning a few large institutions receive a disproportionately high number.\n",
    "* Visualizations prove that the `Expend` attribute also has potential outliers\n",
    "* Visualizations (univariate analysis) on `Top10perc`, `Room.Board`, `Books`, `Personal`, `PhD`, `Terminal`, `S.F.Ratio`, and `perc.alumni` has shown potential outliers beyond statistical checks.\n",
    "* This suggest that careful consideration of data transformation (e.g., log scaling) will be essential during preprocessing to manage their potential impact on ML model performance and to normalize feature distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finding Relationship between Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "So, From the above correlation coefficient Heatmap, we can infer that,\n",
    "* As attribute `Apps` increases `Accept` also increases => Which means, colleges receiving more applications tend to accept a greater number of students.\n",
    "* Similarly,\n",
    "    - `Accept` increases -> `Enroll` will also increase\n",
    "    - `Apps`, or `Accept` or 'Enroll` increases -> `F.Undergrad` will also increase => No. of Full-time Undergraduates increases because they are enrolling more. larger institutions, characterized by higher application and acceptance volumes, generally have a greater number of full-time undergraduate students\n",
    "    - `PhD` increases -> `Terminal` increases -> Faculties with Terminal degree are growing as lot of students studies PhD increases.\n",
    "    - `S.F.Ration` decreases -> `Expend` increases -> As the student-to-faculty ratio decreases (meaning more faculty per student, or smaller class sizes), the instructional expenditure per student tends to increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with a strong correlation, correlation does not imply causation. Just because two variables move together doesn't mean one causes the other. There might be a third, unobserved factor, or the relationship might just be coincidental. Further analysis is needed to find the relationships."
